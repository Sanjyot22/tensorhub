* Please include the versions of TensorFlow (run `pip list | grep tensor`)
* Please provide the command line you ran as well as the log output.

## Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at [INSERT EMAIL ADDRESS]. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.


## How to become a contributor and submit your own code

### Contributor License Agreements

Follow either of the two links above to access the appropriate CLA and instructions for how to sign and return it. Once we receive it, we'll be able to accept your pull requests.

***NOTE***: Only original source code from you and other people that have signed the CLA can be accepted into the main repository.

### Contributing code

If you have improvements to TensorHub, send us your pull requests! For those
just getting started, Github has a [howto](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

TensorHub team members will be assigned to review your pull requests. Once the
pull requests are approved and pass continuous integration checks, a TensorHub
team member will apply `ready to pull` label to your change. This means we are
working on getting your pull request submitted to our internal repository. After
the change has been submitted internally, your pull request will be merged
automatically on GitHub.

If you want to contribute, start working through the TensorHub codebase,
navigate to the
[Github "issues" tab](https://github.com/nityansuman/tensorhub/issues) and start
looking through interesting issues. If you are not sure of where to start, then
start by trying one of the smaller/easier issues here i.e.
[issues with the "good first issue" label](https://github.com/nityansuman/tensorhub/labels/good%20first%20issue)
and then take a look at the
[issues with the "contributions welcome" label](https://github.com/nityansuman/tensorhub/labels/stat%3Acontributions%20welcome).
These are issues that we believe are particularly well suited for outside
contributions, often because we probably won't get to them right now. If you
decide to start on an issue, leave a comment so that other people know that
you're working on it. If you want to help out, but not alone, use the issue
comment thread to coordinate.


### Contribution guidelines and standards

Before sending your pull request for
[review](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls),
make sure your changes are consistent with the guidelines and follow the
TensorFlow coding style.

### General guidelines and philosophy for contribution

*   Include unit tests when you contribute new features, as they help to a)
    prove that your code works correctly, and b) guard against future breaking
    changes to lower the maintenance cost.
*   Bug fixes also generally require unit tests, because the presence of bugs
    usually indicates insufficient test coverage.
*   Keep API compatibility in mind when you change code in core TensorFlow,
    Reviewers of your pull request will comment on any API compatibility issues.
*   When you contribute a new feature to TensorHub, the maintenance burden is
    (by default) transferred to the TensorHub team. This means that benefit of
    the contribution must be compared against the cost of maintaining the
    feature.

### Python coding style

Changes to TensorHub Python code should conform to
[Google Python Style Guide](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md)

Use `pylint` to check your Python changes. To install `pylint` and
retrieve TensorFlow's custom style definition:

```bash
pip install pylint
wget -O /tmp/pylintrc https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/master/tensorflow/tools/ci_build/pylintrc
```

To check a file with `pylint`:

```bash
pylint --rcfile=/tmp/pylintrc myfile.py
```

### License

Include a license at the top of new files.
