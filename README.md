## You have just found TensorHub.

The open source library to help you develop and train ML models, easy and fast as never before with `TensorFlow 2.0`.
`TensorHub` is a global collection of `building blocks` and `ready to serve models`.

It is a wrapper library of deep learning models and neural lego blocks designed to make deep learning more accessible and accelerate ML research.


Use `TensorHub` if you need a deep learning library that:

+ Allows for easy and fast prototyping.

+ Supports both Keras and TensorFlow 2.0.

+ Runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU.


## Available on PyPI
```
pip install tensorhub
```

## Why TensorFlow
TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML powered applications.

**Easy model building**
Build and train ML models easily using intuitive high-level APIs like Keras with eager execution, which makes for immediate model iteration and easy debugging.

**Robust ML production anywhere**
Easily train and deploy models in the cloud, on-prem, in the browser, or on-device no matter what language you use.

**Powerful experimentation for research**
A simple and flexible architecture to take new ideas from concept to code, to state-of-the-art models, and to publication faster.
